How to make your clients ( or managers ) happy:

So let's assume you are a great engineer. You can build anything, in the cleanest, simplest and elegant way possible, with the fewest lines of code. It's all tested. It works 100% of the time with no exceptions. Testers? Who needs tests? You're just that good. 

But even if you are the most brilliant coder in the world, if you don't build the right thing, you entire product is worthless. The world is full of wrong products [examples of failed products -- probably some kickstarters -- ooh the Sims!]. The world is also full of bad programmers in good places. [examples?]

So how do you take all your brilliant engineering skills, and show them off? How do you build not just a good product, in that it works, but the right product, one that your client needs and your customers need.

First, let's look at some common mistakes: 

1. Assuming suggestions are requirements
2. Telling your clients what they want to hear, instead of the reality
3. Telling your client what to build without listening to requirements
4. Building it quickly instead of well
5. Poor communication -- too much detail, too little detail


Second, Here are the strategies for success: they coincide with agile methodologies:

1. Visualization -- be transparent about your work
2. Break it down to atomic pieces
3. Share your opinion, and respect business value
4. Search for realistic estimations
5. Get feedback early and often

Third, here are real world examples of failures and success

Finally, conclusion, review strategies for success.
